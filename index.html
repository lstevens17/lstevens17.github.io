      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am an evolutionary biologist with over a decade of experience using
        state-of-the-art genomics and novel bioinformatic approaches to understand
        how animal genomes evolve. I use nematodes as my primary study system,
        combining large-scale comparative and population genomics across both
        free-living and parasitic species.

    <section>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        My research aims to uncover fundamental principles of genome evolution,
        with a particular focus on extreme genetic diversity, host–parasite
        interactions, and unusual genome biology.

        <h2>Hyperdiversity in parasitic nematodes</h2>
        <p>
          Parasitic nematodes infect billions of humans and animals worldwide and
          are a major cause of chronic disease, food insecurity, and economic loss.
          Despite their impact, we know surprisingly little about how genetic
          variation within parasite populations shapes infection, immune evasion,
          and responses to control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using single-parasite genomics enabled by low-input long-read sequencing,
          I study the origins and consequences of extreme genetic diversity in
          these worms. My work has revealed that individuals of the same species
          can differ profoundly in genome content, particularly in genes involved
          in host interaction. By investigating how this parasite “hyperdiversity”
          is generated, maintained, and deployed during infection, I aim to assess
          how genomic diversity influences the success of drugs and vaccines.

        <h2>The evolution of programmed DNA elimination</h2>
        <p>
          Programmed DNA elimination (PDE) is a striking process in which some
          organisms reproducibly remove specific regions of their genomes from
          somatic cells during early development, generating distinct germline and
          somatic genomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although first described over a century ago, PDE was long considered a
          rare and taxonomically restricted curiosity. My work has shown that PDE
          is far more widespread than previously appreciated, and was even present
          in the ancestors of the model organism <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing on genome sequences from over a hundred free-living nematode
          species, I investigate how this remarkable process has evolved, how it
          operates mechanistically, and why these species delete large portions of
          their genome during early development.
